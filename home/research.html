	    <li><b>NEW</b> Our humble UC Davis research software for
	    scanning credit cards to prevent fraud has run on
	    over <b>1 billion (!)</b> devices. Some of the largest and
	    most popular apps have used it for areas like food
	    delivery, mobile payments, grocery delivery, e-commerce,
	    fashion, restaurants, and more. In the

            <li>
              We invented a new security architecture for web
              browsers, which became <b>the blueprint for Google
              Chrome's security architecture.</b> Elements of this
              research can be found in all major browsers. In the

              We built the <b>first known hardware-based rootkit</b>,

          <h3 class="text-center">Secure web browsers</h3>
          <p><b>OP web browser (<a href="/assets/dl/op.pdf">pdf</a>).</b> This paper
          was the first browser paper from my group, we were the first
          to rethink modern web browser architectures to improve
          security. We also used formal methods to help vet our
          system, and proposed new mechanisms and policies for coping
          with compromised browser plugins.</p>

          <p>Gazelle (<a href="/assets/dl/wang09.pdf">pdf</a>). Extended the basic OP
          architecture and had some new ideas on dealing with display
          security.</p>

          <p>Alhambra (<a href="/assets/dl/tang10.pdf">pdf</a>). Applied
          deterministic replay to web browsers to enable browser
          developers to test new security policies.</p>

          <p>Vex (<a href="/assets/dl/Bandhakavi10.pdf">pdf</a>). Tested
          browser extensions for potential security
          vulnerabilities. Key insight: many vulnerabilities could be
          expressed as information flows. We found several previously
          unknown and subtle vulnerabilities.</p>

          <p><b>IBOS (<a href="/assets/dl/ibos.pdf">pdf</a>)</b>. Built a new browser
          and a new OS specifically for more secure browsers. Our
          specialized OS reduced the trusted computing base for our
          browser by 2-3 orders of magnitude when compared to other
          modern systems.</p>

          <p>ExpressOS (<a href="/assets/dl/mai13.pdf">pdf</a>). Built a new
          OS that included strong formal verification, with support
          for the Android system call interface and
          libraries. Although not strictly a browser, this work builds
          on top of our previous work on secure web browsers directly.</p>

          <p>Cocktail (<a href="/assets/dl/cocktail.pdf">pdf</a>). Uses three
          commodity browsers in concert to add security and
          reliability.</p>

          <p><b>IMP (<a href="/assets/dl/king08.pdf">pdf</a>)</b>. Designed and implemented
          the first processor with hardware backdoors. We learned a
          lot about the threat from this experience.</p>

          <p><b>BlueChip (<a href="/assets/dl/bluechip.pdf">pdf</a>)</b>. Developed a hardware /
          software system for removing suspicious circuits from
          hardware designs. Surprising result: we removed legitimate
          hardware from a hardware design and used software to make
          forward progress safely.</p>

          <p>Defeating UCI
          (<a href="/assets/dl/Sturton11.pdf">pdf</a>). Performed a detailed
          security analysis of the UCI algorithm. We found some subtle
          and clever circuits that showed how to evade our UCI
          algorithm.</p>

          <p>SPECS (<a href="/assets/dl/hicks15.pdf">pdf</a>). Hardware
          support for enforcing security invariants in a modern
          processor. Includes a study of modern processor errata to
          classify them into security and non-security critical bugs.

          <h3 class="text-center">Deterministic replay</h3>
          <p>Capo (<a href="/assets/dl/montesinos09.pdf">pdf</a>). Built the
          first system to combine HW and SW replay systems. We found
          some subtle and interesting interactions when we combined
          the two.</p>

          <p>QuickRec (<a href="/assets/dl/quickrec.pdf">pdf</a>). A hardware prototype from
          Intel of record and replay support that uses the Capo HW/SW
          interface and Capo software.</p>

          <h3 class="text-center">Machine learning for systems and security</h3>

          <p>Laika (<a href="/assets/dl/cozzie08.pdf">pdf</a>). Built a system
          for extracting data structures out of process heaps and
          stacks <i>without</i> using symbols. We found that data
          structures were fairly good at identifying processes, even
          for code-polymorphic malware.</p>

          <p>Macho (<a href="/assets/dl/cozzie11.pdf">pdf</a>). Built a system for
          programming using natural language, examples, and a large
          database of source code. This is still early research, but
          we already generated a few simple coreutils
          applications.</p>

          <p>Building secure robots
          (<a href="/assets/dl/finnicum11.pdf">pdf</a>). Worked on general OS
          abstractions for apps running on general purpose robots,
          with a strong emphasis on security. It turns out that
          computer security is very different when your computer is a
          robot.</p>
