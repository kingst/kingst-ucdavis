        <h2>Recommendations for Graduate School</h2>
        <p>
          I'm willing to write letters of recommendation for students who have typically earned an A or higher in my class. <strong>Letters based primarily on classroom performance have limited impact compared to research-based recommendations. Consider carefully whether this fits your application strategy.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you do decide to ask me for a letter, ask by October 1st. I can only write a limited number of letters so I am not able to accommodate all requests, but I will write as many as I can (typically around 10-20 a year). Iâ€™ll let you know by October 7th if I can write a letter for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's what you can expect and some guidance to help you make the best choice for your applications:
        </p>

        <h2>What I Can Offer</h2>
        <p>My letters will draw on direct observation of your academic work and can speak effectively to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your analytical thinking and problem-solving abilities</li>
            <li>Intellectual curiosity and engagement with course material</li>
            <li>How you handle challenging concepts and coursework</li>
            <li>Academic growth and improvement over the semester</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What to Consider</h2>
        <p><strong>Scope:</strong> My letter will primarily reflect your classroom performance, as this is where I know your work best. I won't have firsthand knowledge of your research experience, extracurricular activities, or achievements outside our class.</p>
        <p><strong>Strategic fit:</strong> For highly competitive graduate programs, having letters that speak to research experience and broader academic potential can be particularly valuable. Consider whether other professors or mentors who know your work more extensively might provide more comprehensive perspectives.</p>

        <h2>My Recommendations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Diversify your letters:</strong> If you request a letter from me, ensure your other recommendation letters can speak to research experience, leadership, or other dimensions of your academic profile.</li>
            <li><strong>Provide context:</strong> Share information about your goals, relevant experiences, or achievements that might help me write a more informed letter.</li>
            <li><strong>Timeline and deadlines:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Submit letter requests by <strong>October 1st</strong>. I will respond to all requests by <strong>October 7th</strong>.</li>
                <li>The earliest application deadlines I can accommodate are <strong>November 1st</strong>.</li>
                <li>This timeline ensures I can write thoughtful recommendations while managing my other commitments.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Consider alternatives:</strong> If you have professors who have supervised your research, worked with you extensively outside class, or know your academic interests deeply, prioritize those relationships for your strongest letters.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I'm committed to writing honest, substantive letters that accurately represent your abilities as I've observed them. My goal is to help you succeed, which sometimes means encouraging you to seek recommendations that will serve your applications most effectively.</p>
