		My research focus is on technology to manage Type 1
		Diabetes. Managing Type 1 Diabetes is hard, and I
		believe that novel software and AI can help make it
		easier. This research area is relatively new for me,
		and I'll post more details here soon.

		I spent seven years in industry with two of them as
		the Head of Accounts at Twitter and two as Head of
		Fraud and Identity at Lyft, and three as the Head of
		Fraud and ML at Stripe, but now I'm back in academia
		at UC Davis. If you're interested, I wrote
		a <a href="https://eng.lyft.com/stopping-fraudsters-by-changing-products-452240f2d2cc">blog
		post</a> that talks about some of the lessons learned
		from my time in industry. I also wrote a blog post
		about why I
		moved <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/naturejobs/2018/04/30/from-academia-to-silicon-valley-and-back/">from
		academia to industry and back</a>.

		Previously I worked on digital identities, fraud,
		fake accounts, and computer security broadly
		speaking. My <a href="research.html">Research</a> page
		shows a nice summary of some of my past projects, and
		my <a href="publications.html">Publications</a> page
		shows a full list of my publications.
