Claude Code: Vibe code hitting the APIs

Read read @inclass_programming/w26-ecs191/SmsAuth/*.md I'd like to add
a button to the home view that will enable me to take pictures of food
using the camera and analyze them. See the API.md file to learn how to
analyze images, and show the user the end results. I added three test
images as Assets for the project: dog, burger_and_fries, and
spaghetti. If the user is running on the simulator we can let them
pick one of these three images instead of using the camera to capture
the image. Can you implement the simulator-based flow?

Gemini Web: Generating a UI

I'm working on an app for logging food by taking pictures of the food
with the camera of a mobile phone. I'm very interested in people who
are tracking daily calories, protein, and carbs. I'm thinking of
having a daily summary at the top and a list of the meals for the day
below, with a tab bar for the home and profile + a prominent camera
button. Can you generate an image that fleshes out this concept?

Generating UI parts for your prompt

Looks great, can you create markdown that I can use in a prompt for
Gemini CLI to synthesize this in a native iOS app?
