            <h2>Presentation and discussion leading</h2>
            <p>
              During the semester you will present one paper to the
              class. Each LECTURE will have 3-4 presenters, sign up
              using <b>suggested edits</b> in
              this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zIaIVQa37UjzVkfemddvJPGy5kwkkvoiZZO7hxEVujg/edit?usp=sharing">Google
              Doc</a>. You can divide up the presentation
              responsibilities however you see fit and you will be
              graded as a group. You must present the paper(s) in a
              style where you assume everyone has read the paper, so
              you focus on the most important aspect of the work. You
              will also be responsible for clearing up any confusing
              aspects of the paper and for leading a discussion. Here
              is a rough guideline for how to lead a discussion:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>5 minutes (max) of background material.</b>
                  Explain what this paper is about and why it is
                  important. Remember, we can assume everyone has
                  already read the paper so keep it short!
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>10-15 minutes of related work.</b> Discuss some
                  other work that may be related to the papers you are
                  presenting and tie them together to help give a
                  historical context of the work.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>20 minutes small group discussion.</b> Come up
                  with several questions to pose to the class to spark
                  discussions. We will discuss in small groups first.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>20 minutes class discussion.</b> Based on the
                  small group discussions, the class will vote on
                  topics to discuss as an entire class.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
              The first paper available to students is the <b>Nested
              Kernel</b> on 1/23.
            </p>

            <p>
              Note: You must turn in a rough draft of your slides to
              the professor by 4pm the night before your presentation
              and after the presentation you must submit a summary of
              what each student contributed to the presentation.
