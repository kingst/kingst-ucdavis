            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
	      This course will teach you how to build software
	      products. We will focus on both the technical aspects of
	      building modern software products as well as the human
	      side. The human side includes coming up with ideas,
	      identifying potential users, getting them to use it, and
	      learning something from their use of your product.
            </p>

            <p>
              The prerequisite for this class is undergraduate
              operating systems (ECS 150 or equivalent).
            </p>

            <h2>Lectures</h2>
            <p>
              You are responsible for knowing about all announcements
              made in lecture. We will discuss expectations about the
              project, suggestions for how to succeed, and grading
              guidelines in class, and general class policy issues, so
              make sure you don't miss any lectures.
            </p>

            <h2>Do I need use AI tools?</h2>
            <p>
	      Yes, but I'm not going to enforce it. AI tools have to
	      potential to speed up your ability to build software
	      products. Through this class you will get experience
	      using modern AI tools for building software, but at the
	      end of the day if you choose to build software by hand,
	      without automation, that is fine too. The point is
	      shipping products, not using AI tools.
