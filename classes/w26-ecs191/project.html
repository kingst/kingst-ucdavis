            <h2>Project</h2>
            <p>
              This quarter you will design and ship an app. The goal is
              for you to get experience with modern AI tools for rapid
              prototyping of realistic applications suitable for people
              to use. As a part of this project, you will build a usable
              app, get people to use it, and learn something about their
              use of your product.
            </p>

            <p>
              Project groups should be 4-5 members. Any other group size
              needs explicit approval by the professor.
            </p>

	    <a id="requirements"></a>
            <h4>Requirements</h4>
            <p>
              Your project must include:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>A native mobile app.</b> Either iOS (written in
                  Swift) or Android (written in Kotlin) are fine. No
                  Javascript, react native, web, flutter, or other cross
                  platform tools can be used.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>A server.</b> Your server will provide APIs for
                  your app to use and must be written in Python and run
                  in Google's App Engine.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>A differentiated feature.</b> Your app has to do
                  something that is better / different from apps
                  today. Differentiation doesn't mean no one has ever
                  done anything like it -- it means your specific
                  combination of features, UX, or target users creates
                  something different from what's available today.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Include an AI feature.</b> Your app must include at
                  least one AI feature, and the interface to this
                  feature must <i>not</i> be chat. We use a broad
                  definition of "AI" that includes ML running on your
                  phone or API calls out to services that provide AI
                  features. The AI feature can either be the main
                  feature for your app, or it can be a subtle part of it
                  that is outside of the main value your app provides,
                  but it must include one AI feature.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

	    <a id="problem"></a>
            <h3>Problem selection</h3>
            <p>
              We will spend time in class and provide a homework
              assignment to help you think of an idea. Coming up with an
              idea that you are excited about is important because this
              class is a lot of work, and if you're genuinely excited
              about the idea then it'll make your experience in the
              class much better.
            </p>

            <p>
              We <i>strongly suggest</i>, but don't require, that you
              pick a problem that college students have. This type of
              problem has two advantages: (1) as college students you
              can think of problems you have and see if it generalizes
              to other students and (2) when you need to find people to
              use your app, you have access to a lot of college
              students, making your job of finding users easier.
            </p>

	    <a id="aplus"></a>
            <h3>Want an A+?</h3>
            <p>
              If during the quarter you get 350 daily active users,
              you'll get an A+ in the class independent of the rest of
              your graded materials. Above all I love impact, so if you
              can show that people are getting value from your app this
              quarter I will give you full credit for the class.
              Note: This is the only way to get an A+ in this class.
            </p>

            <p>
              The requirements for getting an A+ are:
              <ul>
                <li>You need to have 350 daily active users by the day
                that the project is due</li>
                <li>Students from this class can count towards your 350
                daily active users. In fact, I want students to help
                each other out by using your apps and giving
                feedback</li>
                <li>You can't pay people to use your app and you can't
                have bots act as "users" -- it has to be real
                humans</li>
                <li>If you want to try this, you need to have a written
                agreement with Professor King about how you define and
                measure daily active users</li>
                <li>Your app needs to be created this quarter as a part
                of this class. You can't bring in past projects that
                you've worked on and get credit</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Project Details</h2>
            <p>
              There are two main aspects to this project: technical and
              user related. From a technical perspective, we want you to
              demonstrate the ability to write software quickly, making
              use of AI tools where appropriate. From a user
              perspective, we want you to get people to use your app and
              learn something from the experience. Even if you learn
              that your idea doesn't solve the problem you set out to
              solve, that is still learning!
            </p>

	    <a id="technical"></a>
            <h3>Technical artifacts</h3>
            <p>
              Documentation and test cases are key to getting the most
              out of agentic programming tools. These are just as
              important as producing reasonable source code and in fact
              maybe even more important because they're how you will be
              able to produce reasonable source code. The main technical
              artifacts are:
              <ul>
                <li>Source code for your app and server hosted on
                GitHub.</li>

                <li>Some way for the staff to run your app, ideally in
                the app store or TestFlight.</li>

                <li>An <code>overview.md</code> file. This is a high
                level document that describes the fundamentals of your
                app and includes (1) what problem are you solving and
                why is it important, (2) how have others solved this
                problem and what is wrong with these solutions, (3) what
                is different about your solution and why does it solve
                the problem, and (4) what are the key measures of
                success for your app (or in other words, how will you
                know that it actually solves the problem).</li>

                <li>A <code>client_architecture.md</code> and
                <code>server_architecture.md</code> file that explain
                your high level architecture. These architecture
                documents should explain the main components of your
                client or server (the most important 5-10 modules), the
                key data structures, and the main interfaces within your
                application.</li>

                <li>An <code>API.md</code> file that defines the APIs
                that you will expose from your server for your client to
                call.</li>

                <li>Test cases and scripts to run your test cases from
                the command line. These are critical because agentic
                programming tools will use these to know if their
                implementation is correct and fix any mistakes that it
                makes. Having scripts to run test cases from the command
                line enables your AI tools to run test cases
                automatically as it implements features. <i>Hint:</i>
                Agentic programming tools are <i>very good</i> at
                creating test cases automatically, just make sure that
                you check them by hand to confirm that they're testing
                what they should be testing.</li>

                <li>Specs for all features. For each feature that you
                implement, make sure to pick something relatively small
                in size. Examples include a single API handler in your
                server or a single view + associated logic in your
                client. With this scope of feature, write a detailed
                document (e.g., <code>myfeature.md</code>) to explain to
                the AI tools what you want it to implement. This
                description tends to be fairly detailed and includes (1)
                a description of the feature, (2) an explanation of how
                it fits within the architecture of your app and for the
                subcomponents of your feature, (3) key data structures
                and functions, and (4) a description of each of the
                features and data structures you outline. From this,
                plus test cases, agentic programming tools should be
                able to provide a reasonable implementation.</li>
              </ul>

            <h3>User artifacts</h3>
            <p>
              To measure if your app is solving the problem you set out
              to solve, you need to have both simple quantitative
              metrics and qualitative data from talking to the people
              who use your app. The details of these will be highly
              specific to each app and will be something that the course
              staff will work with you to develop over the quarter.
            </p>

	    <a id="milestones"></a>
            <h3>Milestones</h3>
            <p>
              To help provide you with feedback and guidance, we
              decomposed the project into a number of different
              milestones throughout the quarter. These milestones help
              you ensure that you're making steady progress on your
              project and give the staff an opportunity to let you know
              what's going well and your areas of improvement.
            </p>

	    <a id="proposal"></a>
            <h4>Project proposal</h4>
            <p>
              The project proposal is simple: a two sentence description
              of your app and a list of group members. This milestone
              serves as a forcing function to get you to form a team and
              to have an initial idea of what you're going to work on.
            </p>

	    <a id="milestone0"></a>
            <h4>Milestone 0: One app view + API call</h4>
            <p>
              Milestone 0 is all about getting the basics in place to
              start implementing your app. It includes having a first
              cut of all of your <code>overview.md</code>,
              <code>client_architecture.md</code>,
              <code>server_architecture.md</code>, and
              <code>API.md</code> files. It also includes one feature
              (<code>somefeature.md</code>), test cases, and a
              demonstration of your app talking to your server.
            </p>

            <p>
              Your architecture and API files do not need to be complete
              as these will evolve as you make progress on your app, but
              you should have these for at least the parts of your app
              you are working on at this point.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>What to turn in:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>A link to your github repo that includes all of the
                documents + source code that you have thus far.</li>
              </ul>

              <b>When we meet:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Be ready to show us your app working either on a
                simulator or a real device.</li>
                <li>Have a two sentence description of your app.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

	    <a id="milestone1"></a>
            <h4>Milestone 1: One AI feature</h4>
            <p>
              Milestone 1 is about getting the beginnings of your app
              working. You should have several views working and
              integrated with the server to do whatever you need them to
              do. Focus on the feature that adds value to people rather
              than the types of features that any app would have, like a
              login page.
            </p>

            <p>
              For this milestone, you need to have something AI related
              integrated into your app and be ready to demonstrate it at
              our meeting.
            </p>

            <p>
              At this milestone, you should also have talked to 10
              potential users of your app to learn about what they might
              want.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>What to turn in:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>A link to your github repo that includes all of the
                documents + source code that you have thus far,
                including <code>discovery_summary.md</code> and
                <code>discovery_details.md</code>.</li>
                <li>A <code>discovery_summary.md</code> file that
                concisely summarizes what you learned from your 10
                discovery conversations.</li>
                <li>A <code>discovery_details.md</code> file that shows
                the raw notes from your conversations. <i>Hint:</i> Take
                notes as you talk to people and this requirement should
                be easy.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Important:</b> For the two discovery docs, make sure
              that these are <i>not</i> written by an LLM. You can use
              an LLM to clean up grammar, make it more concise, etc, but
              I want you to <i>think</i> about the synthesis of these
              conversations yourself, don't just rely on ChatGPT to tell
              you what you learned. Human insight here is key.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>When we meet:</b>
              <ul>

	    <a id="milestone2"></a>
            <h4>Milestone 2: Main feature working, classmates use your app</h4>
            <p>
              In this milestone, you will have your main feature working
              and swap apps with a different group in the class. In
              other words, you use their app and they use your app and
              you provide each other with feedback.
            </p>

            <p>
              Fundamentally, you have to have enough of your app working
              so that you can test out how well it solves the problem
              you're working on for these people. Since classmates will
              be using it, your app can have some rough edges as they
              will be understanding.
            </p>

	    </p>
	    
	    <a id="final"></a>
            <h4>Final project</h4>
            <p>
              At the end of the quarter, you will submit your final
              project. This project will include all documentation from
              the quarter, updated to reflect the final state of your
              app, and some way for the staff to test out your app
              (TestFlight link, build instructions, App store link,
              etc.). Your instructions need to be clear so that we can
              run and test your app.
            </p>

            <p>
              In this final phase, you will get 5 people from outside of
              the class to use your app and give you feedback. Learning
              something from this feedback is the goal, even if the
              feedback is negative. Having an app that people are unable
              to use due to bugs or difficult UI/UX will result in a
              significant loss in points. Having a smooth experience
              that people hate will make you eligible for full credit.
