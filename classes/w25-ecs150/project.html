            <h2>Projects</h2>

	    <p>
	      This quarter we will have four projects that we designed
	      to give you experience with system design and
	      implementation. You will write programs that demonstrate
	      the concepts that we cover in class. Broadly speaking,
	      we will divide the projects in to two different
	      categories. The first category will be relatively small
	      and self-contained projects, but we will give three of
	      them over the first four weeks of the class. The second
	      category will be larger projects, and these will come in
	      the second half of the class and will be spread out over
	      several weeks.
	    </p>
	    
	    <h3>Processes, system APIs, threads, and concurrency</h3>
            <p>
	      During the first part of the quarter, we will give you
	      three projects covering basic command line utilitites,
	      processes, multi-threaded programming, and
	      synchronization.
	    </p>
	    <h3>Distributed file systems</h3>
	    <p>
	      In the second part of this quarter, we'll have one
	      larger project where you will implement a distributed
	      file system.
	    </p>
	    <h3>Group or individual?</h3>
	    <p>
	      You are welcome to work with other students in this
	      class, but you must write and submit your own
	      solutions. You may not copy any code and we will
	      consider any copied code to be a violation of our
	      cheating policy.
