            <h2>Project</h2>
            <p>
              You will design and carry out a quarter-long project
              where you will write an iOS app (done in teams). I hope
              that these projects will lead apps in the App Store. The
              timeline for the projects is as follows:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>2/11:</b> Inform me of your group's membership
                  and few sentence description of the app you plan to
                  build. Groups should generally consist of three or
                  four people. Your project partners will have a
                  substantial effect on your experience in this
                  course, so choose carefully.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>2/22:</b> Milestone 1. This milestone includes
                  preliminary designs with how you plan to decompose
                  your app, descriptions of libraries you plan to use,
                  what you plan to do for server support, and a
                  timeline of when we can expect tasks to be done and
                  who is going to do them. <b>We'll set your
                  Professor's Challenge in your Milestone 1
                  meeting.</b>
		</li>

                <li>
                  <b>3/1:</b> Milestone 2 due. Milestone 2
                  will be set during your "Milestone 1" meeting with
                  me and the TA.
                </li>

		<li>
		  <b>3/10 and 3/11:</b> Live demos. You will demo your app to
		  the rest of the class during the lecture period.
		</li>

                <li>
                  <b>3/16 @ 3pm:</b> Final project due.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
              Project groups should be 4-5 members. Any other group
              size needs explicit approval by the professor.
            </p>

            <p>
              This quarter I am not going to give out project
              ideas. You are responsible for coming up with an app
              idea by yourself, but I encourage you to start this
              process early and to solicit feedback from me.
            </p>

            <h2>Project Details</h2>
	    <h4>Want an A+?</h4>
	    <p>
	      Put your app in the App Store and get 250 daily active
	      users, and you'll get an A+ in the class independent of
	      the rest of your graded materials. Above all I love
	      impact, so if you can show that people are getting value
	      from your app this quarter I will give you full credit
	      for the class. The requirements for this are:
	      <ul>
		<li>You need to have 250 daily active users by the day
		that the project is due</li>
		<li>Students from this class can count towards your
		150 daily active users. In fact, I <i>want</i>
		students to help each other out by using your apps and
		giving feedback</li>
		<li>You can't pay people to use your app</li>
		<li>If you want to try this, you need to have a
		written agreement with Professor King about how you
		define and measure daily active users</li>
		<li>Your app needs to be created this quarter as a
		part of this class. You can't bring in past projects
		that you've worked on and get credit</li>
	      </ul>
	    </p>

	    <a id="proposal"></a>
	    <h4>Project proposal</h4>
	    <p>
	      Write a few sentences describing the app that you plan
	      to build. It doesn't have to be detailed, we're only
	      want to get a general idea of what direction you're
	      thinking about going to make sure that your project is
	      appropriate for this class.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      Please submit the group membership assignment via Canvas
	      to inform us about group membership because we need to
	      create your groups manually in Canvas.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      After we create your group, you should be able to submit
	      a single proposal for the entire group using Canvas'
	      group feature.
	    </p>

	    <a id="milestone1"></a>
	    <h4>Milestone 1</h4>
	    <p>
	      The key activities for Milestone 1 are around planning
	      and getting setup to execute on your app. I do expect
	      that you've started programming when Milestone 1 is due,
	      but I won't grade you on that. Here's what you will need
	      to turn in:
	      <ul>
		<li>Designs for all of the screens you plan to
		have. These designs <i>do not</i> need to be pixel
		perfect, and in fact they shouldn't be. Use a
		whiteboard and take pictures, or better yet use a tool
		like <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a> that
		lets you draw sketch / wireframe designs easily.</li>
		<li>A listing of all third party libraries you plan to use</li>
		<li>Server support for your app. If you plan to roll
		your own server support, a full listing of the APIs
		you plan to build</li>
		<li>A listing of all of the models you plan to include
		in your app</li>
		<li>A listing of all ViewControllers you will
		implement. Please include how you plan to navigate to
		/ from each ViewController and any protocols /
		delegates / variables you plan to use for
		ViewController / ViewController communication</li>
		<li>A list of approximately week long tasks and a
		timeline of when each of them will be done</li>
		<li>A trello board that includes all of the tasks and
		their state (up next, in progress, blocked, done). <b>
		These tasks need to include an owner from the start,
		but the owner can change during the quarter as
		needed</b></li>
		<li>A github classroom project that includes all of
		this documentation. The Readme in your project needs
		to include a link to your Trello board and pictures of
		each of the team members with their name and github
		handle</li>
		<li>A testing plan. A good app should get feedback
		from potential users early and often. List here what
		you plan to get other people to test out. Having your
		friends or classmates from other groups help you with
		testing is acceptable (and encouraged). You should
		have at least one aspect that you measure with each
		test. Measurements can be quantitative (e.g., how long
		does it take for them to signup for a new account) or
		based on survey data (e.g., answers to "from a scale
		of 1-5 how easy was it to signup?")</li>
	      </ul>
	      Please note that this is <i>not</i> a contract -- I
	      fully expect this all to change as the quarter
	      progresses and you write software. Please do keep all of
	      it consistent with the state of your app as you make
	      progress though.
	    </p>
	    <a id="milestone2"></a>
	    <h4>Milestone 2</h4>
	    <p>
	      The goal of milestone 2 is to make sure that you're
	      making sufficient progress towards finishing your final
	      project. By milestone 2 we should see significant code
	      at either broad progress across the entire app <i>or</i>
	      deep progress on one or more areas. At this point you
	      should have experience with all of the third parties you
	      plan to use, and you should have picked your "magical"
	      experience or advanced feature that we talked about
	      during your Milestone 1 meeting.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Some groups got explicit instructions to email me about
	      something during your Milestone 1 meeting, we'll follow
	      up on that during our Milestone 2 meeting so please do
	      make sure that you've taken action before you meet with
	      us.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Here's what you need to turn in:
	      <ul>
		<li>a link to your most recent sprint planning document</li>
	      </ul>
	      We're not going to grade it twice, but we will use it to
	      get a sense of where you are for our in person meeting.
	    </p>
	    <a id="sprint"></a>
	    <h4>Sprint planning, standups, and Trello</h4>
	    <p>
	      You are responsible for meeting with your group three
	      times a week. Twice a week your meetings can be
	      quick <i>standups</i> where you briefly talk about (1)
	      what you're up to over the next few days (2) what you
	      did over the previous few days and (3) anything your
	      stuck on. If you're spending more than 10 minutes on
	      these meetings, then you're spending too much time on
	      them. Having standups over Slack or another online tool
	      is fine as long as everyone is logged in at the same
	      time to provide feedback.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Each week you should have a longer <i>sprint
	      planning</i> meeting that should last for about one hour
	      and needs to be in person. In this meeting you will also
	      talk about (1) what you did (2) what you plan to do and
	      (3) any issues you're having, but it will be for the
	      entire week, not just a few days. <b>You must take notes
	      in this meeting about (1), (2), and (3) and submit these
	      notes via Github to get credit. Include links to all PRs
	      / commits in Github that correspond to tasks.</b> Please
	      create a Markdown document in Github to record your
	      notes for your sprint planning meeting and make sure to
	      include:
	      <ul><li>A 2-3 sentence summary of your project</li>
		  <li>A link to your up-to-date trello board</li>
		  <li>Notes that includes what people have done, what
		  they plan to do, etc for each individual in the
		  group</li>
		  <li>Links to all commits that correspond to the
		  tasks that people have done</li>
		  <li>If you did a task that didn't require any code
		  (e.g., test out API foo to see if it works), put a
		  description of the task instead of a link to a
		  commit</li>
	      </ul>
	      <b>To get credit for sprint planning, you must submit a
	      URL that links to your markdown document via Canvas</b>
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      To track work, you will use <i>Trello.</i> In Trello,
	      you will maintain four lists: up next, in progress,
	      blocked, done. Each task in your Trello board should
	      take about one week of work and <b>You are required to
	      keep your Trello board up-to-date at all times.</b> The
	      main idea behind Trello is to make your committments
	      explicit and to provide visibility as to what you're
	      doing at any given time.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      On a personal note, pure "agile development" borders on
	      being rediculous and teams that work on difficult
	      problems don't use it. You should identify the most
	      important things that need to be worked on and work on
	      them, and you should be thoughtful about diagnosing
	      issues when things don't go as expected, but story
	      points and weekly retrospectives are counterproductive
	      and impractical. In this class we'll use what I think
	      are the good parts of agile development, but this is
	      something I encourage you to form an opinion about
	      yourselves.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      A more healthy approach is to focus your conversations
	      on impact and quantitative metrics, but that will be
	      difficult in this class as you are building out the
	      product itself -- the focus on impact usually comes
	      after you actually have a product.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Agile development is very good at fostering
	      communication, providing visibility into what you're
	      working on, and identifying any issues that might come
	      up early, so we're focusing our use of Agile development
	      on these facets.
	    </p>

	    <a id="demo"></a>
	    <h4>Demo</h4>
	    <p>
	      During the last lecture of the class you will have the
	      opportunity to demo your app to your peers. Everyone
	      will setup in an area of the classroom and then people
	      will roam around the room to checkout what people have
	      done. During this period, Zhiyi and I will go from group
	      to group and you will have a chance to show off your
	      app. For your demo grade, here's what we're going to be
	      looking at (roughly equal weight for each item):
	      <ul>
		<li>You will explain what problem you're solving, why
		it's important, and how your solution is
		different.</li>
		<li>Show us the "magical" experience in your app.</li>
		<li>Show us the one smooth and polished flow in your
		app.</li>
	      </ul>
	    </p>

	    <a id="final"></a>
	    <h4>Final project</h4>
	    <p>
	      For your final project, the main artifact you need to
	      submit is your code. We will be compiling your app using
	      Xcode 12 so please make sure that your app
	      compiles. For your grade, we will be looking at (roughly
	      equal weight):
	      <ul>
		<li><i>The basics and documentation.</i> Does it
		compile, is the code organized in a reasonable way,
		etc. The only bit of documentation we need beyond what
		we're expecting for sprint plannint notes is a short
		decription of what each project member did.</li>
		<li><i>API Usage.</i> Are you using APIs in a
		reasonably efficient way, handle basic errors,
		etc.</li>
		<li><i>App completeness.</i> Your app needs to be
		complete (e.g., no dead ends when using it). This may
		mean cutting scope for the final version of your app,
		but the parts that you turn in need to be complete.
		<li><i>UI / UX.</i> Appropriate and logical flows in
		the app, the app should be usable by a new user
		without reading instructions outside of the app.</li>
		<li><i>Code quality.</i> Your code should be easy to
		read and understand and it should appear to have been
		written by a single person.</li>
		<li><i>App quality.</i> Does your app provide at least
		one experience that is compelling for users and is
		there potential to extend it into something more.</li>
	      </ul>
	    </p>

	    <a id="peer"></a>
	    <h4>Peer grading</h4>
	    <p>
	      A portion of your final project grade will be set by
	      your project partners. If you get full credit I expect
	      the sprint planning documentation to reflect a project
	      partner who is contributing to the project, and if you
	      don't get full credit then I expect to see some early
	      warning signs in your sprint planning documents.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Your peer grade will be the average of the grades that
	      your project partners give you. My hope is that if there
	      are any issues that you'll talk about it openly as a
	      group early when there is still time for any project
	      members to improve.
	    </p>

	    <a id="appsentence"></a>
	    <h4>What does your app do?</h4>
	    <p>
	      One important aspect of this class is being able to
	      explain to other people what it is that you're
	      building. As a first step, you'll need to explain
	      to <i>me</i> what you're building in a way that makes
	      sense.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      We suggest that you use
	      the <a href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/how-to-pitch-your-company/">Y
	      Combinator</a> guidance on how to answer the question of
	      "What do you do?". Please make sure to see their
	      suggestions for how to forumlate your answer and look at
	      the end of the blog post for guidance on improving your
	      answer.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      The first thing I'm going to ask you in all of our
	      face-to-face meetings is "what does your app do?" so
	      please make sure that you're prepared to answer that
	      question and work on improving it as the quarter goes
	      on.
