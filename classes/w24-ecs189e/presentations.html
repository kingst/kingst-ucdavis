            <h2>Presentation and discussion leading</h2>
            <p>
              During the semester you will present one paper to the
              class. Each LECTURE will have 3-4 presenters, sign up by
              editing
              this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zIaIVQa37UjzVkfemddvJPGy5kwkkvoiZZO7hxEVujg/edit?usp=sharing">Google
              Doc</a>. I periodically grab this data from Google Docs
              and sync it to the course website. You can divide up the
              presentation responsibilities however you see fit and
              you will be graded as a group. You must present the
              paper(s) in a style where you assume everyone has read
              the paper, so you focus on the most important aspect of
              the work. You will also be responsible for clearing up
              any confusing aspects of the paper and for leading a
              discussion. Here is a rough guideline for how to lead a
              discussion:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>5 minutes (max) of background material.</b>
                  Explain what this paper is about and why it is
                  important. Remember, we can assume everyone has
                  already read the paper so keep it short!
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>10-15 minutes of related work.</b> Discuss some
                  other work that may be related to the papers you are
                  presenting and tie them together to help give a
                  historical context of the work.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>20 minutes small group discussion.</b> Come up
                  with several questions to pose to the class to spark
                  discussions. We will discuss in small groups first.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>20 minutes class discussion.</b> Based on the
                  small group discussions, the class will vote on
                  topics to discuss as an entire class.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
              The first paper available to students is the <b>Nested
              Kernel</b> on 1/23.
            </p>

            <p>
              Note: You must turn in a rough draft of your slides to
              the professor by 4pm the night before your presentation
              and after the presentation you must submit a summary of
              what each student contributed to the presentation.
