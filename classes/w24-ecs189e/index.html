            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
	      This course will teach you how to write apps for both
	      Android and iOS. We will focus on how these systems work
	      behind the scenes, and discuss â€‹why they do things the
	      way they do. At the end, students will be able to write
	      moderately complex iOS apps.
            </p>

            <p>
              The prerequisite for this class is undergraduate
              operating systems (ECS 150 or equivalent).
            </p>

            <h2>Lectures</h2>
            <p>
              You are responsible for knowing about all announcements
              made in lecture. We will discuss expectations about the
              project, suggestions for how to succeed, and grading
              guidelines in class, and general class policy issues, so
              make sure you don't miss any lectures.
            </p>

            <h2>Do I need ECS 150 (undergrad OS)?</h2>
            <p>
	      Yes, but I'm not going to enforce it. Among the topics
	      I'm going to assume you're comfortable with are threads
	      and synchronization, networking, and file systems and
	      storage. Pragmatically, without these you can still get
	      quite a bit out of the class and <i>not</i> having 150
	      will hurt you for about 1/3 of the content in the
	      class. Specifically, this means that:
	      <ul>
		<li>You are likely to struggle with 3 or 4 of the quizzes.</li>
		<li>You will likely get less out of about 1/3 of the lectures.</li>
		<li>You will still be able to write iOS apps at the end of the quarter, even though you'll miss some of the most important parts of the class.</li>
	      </ul>
