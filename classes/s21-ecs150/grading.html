            <h2>Grading</h2>
            <p>
              <h5>Turning in work and late policy</h5> Late work will
              receive no credit. However, you have two free "late days"
              that you can use at anytime during the quarter on a
              project. A late day gives you one extra day
              to turn in your homework without penalty. The purpose of
              these late days is to help you deal with unexpected
              events, including getting sick, going to the doctor, or
              any other events that might cause you to turn in your
              homework late.
	    </p>

	    <p>We will track late days automatically, but if you use
	    late days but don't have any available (e.g., you submit a
	    project late but you don't have any late days left) we
	    will give you a 0 on the project. Unfortunately, we don't
	    have a way to encode the late day policy in the autograder
	    currently.</p>


            <p>
            <h5>Cheating policy</h5>
              I have a no tolerance policy on cheating, which includes
              copying from friends and plagarism. If you get caught
              cheating, you will get an F in this class and I will
              turn you into the univerisity's academic integrity
              group.
            </p>

            <p>
              <h5>Extra Credit</h5>
              Extra credit will be assigned based off of participation on piazza to encourage a helpful class forum. 
              This includes answers, questions and overall contributions, which includes followup discussions.
              Extra credit can add up to 3% to the overall grade.
              </p>

            <p>
            <h5>Grade breakdown</h5> Your grade will be composed of
            the following items:

		    grade (5% each for the first two and 10% for the
		    third) and the 1-2 projects on network programming
		    and distributed systems will be worth 20% of your
